# Shell Dotfiles

![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cadnza/shDotFiles)

_Zsh_ dotfiles, specifically. Here's what you get:

### A beautiful prompt

-   Colorblind-safe colors for user, machine, and directory
-   Most colors within the first 15 Xterm colors for per-emulator customization
-   Machine name that changes by OS
-   All color definitions in a very conveniently packaged single file

### Handy Git indicators

-   Branch and repo to the right that disappear when you type over them
-   Smart change indicators that show for staged and unstaged changes _only_ when displaying them doesn't slow down the terminal (Because it does sometimes. It's terrible.)
-   A subtle indicator for repos that are too large for change indicators
-   Fast unpushed and unpulled commit indicators for all repos, regardless of size
-   No effect on performance in directories that aren't repos

### A very handy `.nanorc`

-   Highlighting for most languages (special thanks to [Benjamin Chan](https://github.com/benjamin-chan) for [R](https://gist.github.com/benjamin-chan/4ef37955eabf5fa8b9e70053c80b7d76#file-r-nanorc) and [Anthony Scopatz](https://github.com/scopatz) for [Swift](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc/blob/master/swift.nanorc))
-   Line numbering
-   High contrast without giving you a headache
-   A nice ruler at 80 characters
-   A scroll bar (Well, an indicator anyway. You can't scroll with it.)

### Short files and easy setup

-   Because short files are happy files. ðŸ™‚

### Syntax highlighting

-   With [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

### Aliases, path, etc.

-   You get it.

## Setup

Nice and easy. Here's what you do:

1. Pull the repo
2. Symlink `.zshrc`, `.nanorc`, and `.shDotFileSupport` into `~` by those names (and `.Rprofile` if you want)
3. Start your zsh ðŸ˜Ž
